# Why Reproducible research?
<hr>

--

* On average authors run their analyses 15-20 times in the course of submitting a paper. Therefore,
it is important to have reproducible workflow.

--

* Future yourself will not remember methods or codes you are using right now.

--

* reproducibility is accompanied with automation of repetitive tasks. Therefore, 
it will improve your productivity incrementally.

# Why transparent research?
<hr>

--

* It improves the credibility of your work as anyone can re-create your work at anytime, anywhere.

--

* minimize  errors
--

* Increasingly, good academic journals make it mandatory to share codes that generated the results.

# How does reproducible work look like?

# Main features of reproducible workflow
<hr>
--

`r "\U1F5C4️"`  Well organized

--

`r "\U1F4BE"` Portable / `r "\U1F4E7"` Easily shareable

--

`r "\U1F4B4"` Do not depend on commercial software (.red[**learn**] 
![](jc1/img/r-logo-tiny.png) you will `r "\U1F497"` it!)

--

`r "\U1F9FE"` Well-documented codes (how many of you know the shortcut to make comments in `stata` do files?)

--

`r "\U1F501"` Repeated codes are in _`functions`_

--

`r "\U1F463"` Able to go back to older versions of your analysis (version control)

# Getting started
<hr>

--

* Remember, being _.purple[partially reproducible]_ is better than _.red[not at all reproducible]_. 
Just try to make your next paper or project better organized than the last.

--

* Identify **one weakness** in your current approach, adopt an improved approach, refine that a bit, 
and then move on to the next thing.

--

* Practice ![](jc1/img/r-logo-tiny.png) by translating your old `stata` projects to ![](jc1/img/r-logo-tiny.png) 

--

* Do everything with a script(`.do` files if in stata) 

--

* Separate row data from derived data

--

* Organize everything within one folder/ choose file names carefully (don't use things like `_final`)
